Please create  a directory named youraccount.esameSNP51 in your home on
hplinux2.unisalento.it (e.g. franco.esameSNP51) and solve the exercise
in that directory or, alternatively, create a directory with the same
name in your macOS home, and solve the exercise in that directory.
Eventually, transfer it to your home on hplinux2.unisalento.it.

The created programs must be SUSv3 compliant and a makefile must be
provided. If the solution and the compliance are not possible together,
the solution must anyway be working both on Linux and macOS. In the same
directory, a file named README.txt containing a description of the
solution and, possibly, comments/observations on the choices made to
solve the problem, MUST be placed. Keep in mind that the file may help
the reader to understand the logic you adopted and to better appreciate
your work.

When finished, issue in your own Linux account the following command
line:

cd; tar cvfz $USER.esameSNP51.tgz $USER.esameSNP51

[ BEWARE: the command above shown must be issued in the shell running in
the Linux machine, AFTER the folder youraccount.esameSNP51 has been
transferred to your home on hplinux2.unisalento.it and NOT when it's
still in your home on macOS (in the case you wrote the program there).

Exercise

Build a multicast sender T and a multicast receiver R operating as
follows:

1) T places a point at coordinates {40,40} in a square matrix of 80x80
points. Such point starts moving, one step per second, to one of the 8
adjacent points in a random direction, while T sends its position at
each new step to a multicast address.

2) R receives from T the multicast transmission of the current point's
position in the matrix and represents it, graphically and dinamically,
in a terminal window (i.e. using the noncanonical mode).

Esercizio

Costruisci un mittente multicast T e un ricevitore multicast R operante come
segue:

1) T pone un punto alle coordinate {40,40} in una matrice quadrata di 80x80
punti. Tale punto inizia a muoversi, un passo al secondo, verso uno degli 8
punti adiacenti in una direzione casuale, mentre T invia la sua posizione a
ogni nuovo passo verso un indirizzo multicast.

2) R riceve da T la trasmissione multicast dei punti correnti
posizione nella matrice e la rappresenta, graficamente e dinamicamente,
in una finestra di terminale (ovvero utilizzando la modalità non canonica).
